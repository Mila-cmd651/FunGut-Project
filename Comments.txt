Hi! I thought we could use this as a place to put our updates / problems or any comment that we have

Maybe everytime we worked on the project we could put "Our name + date on which we worked + what we did / at what point we stopped" so that when someone else begins working on the project we don't loose time trying to understand what was done previously!

I successfully imported the data, with a short coding command. My next step would be to do the denoizing part, and potentially also a bit of analysis of the sample metadata.

Comments for our next meeting:
Answer the basic questions that are asked in our FunGut guideline + the general group project guideline.
It could be interesting, once we know the taxa, to look if this is coherent with current literature with what their diet / health issues etc are. See what factors seem to be the strongest -> health issues over diet or I don't know
May be look if these taxa are indicator of good health or not, and even maybe try to find literature on how these subject could enhance their gut health
